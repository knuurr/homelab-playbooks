# homelab-playbooks


Playbooks used for provisioning my home server. 
I extensively describe how I setup my home server, along with explanation of various choices I made in ![my homeserver writeup](https://github.com/knuurr/homelab-writeup).


Created initially to learn about DevOps and automation technologies. 

I publish it because I'm confident that someone might benefit and learn from my work.

I tested this playbook on my machine and I consider it working, but this is an WIP project, so changes, bugs should be expected. 


Things to consider:

- adjust Ansible user elevation in playbooks
- fix oh-my-zsh install and plugin instllation
- (eventually) move it all to Kubernetes


All remarks and questions related to my project welcome :)
